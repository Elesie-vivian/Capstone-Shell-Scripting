Bash Script for Generating a Multiplication Table

This project will create a Bash Script that generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. 
It will incorporate the practice of loops, handling user inputs with ‘read’ commands, and applying conditional logic in Bash Scripting.


We use the vim text editor to develop our script then run it on Ubuntu terminal as shown below.

The script output generates a multiplication table for a full table as
entered by the user with an added feature of generating a full table
for using List form loop as well as c-style loop.
